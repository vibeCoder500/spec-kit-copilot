# AGENTS.md — Maintainer guidance for Spec Kit Copilot integrations

This file captures the design decisions behind these integrations so they are not
accidentally reverted when revving or regenerating it. Read this before adding,
removing, or regenerating skills.

## What this repository is

The **Copilot integration hub for Spec Kit**. It can contain independently versioned
Copilot CLI/App plugins, skills, extensions, canvases, hooks, and workflow surfaces.
Do not assume every integration belongs in the core skills plugin.

## Core skills plugin

A **GitHub Copilot CLI plugin** (`plugin.json` + `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) that
exposes the Spec Kit **`specify` CLI** to the Copilot agent. Each skill documents a
`specify` command group and tells the agent *when* and *how* to shell out to
`specify`. The plugin does **not** dispatch prompts to another agent — Copilot itself
runs the CLI.

## Core decisions (do not silently undo)

1. **The integration is always Copilot in skills mode — do NOT expose `specify integration`.**
   This is the *Copilot* plugin, so the agent is already Copilot. Managing or
   switching integrations (claude, gemini, etc.) is meaningless here. There is
   intentionally **no `speckit-integration` skill**. Do not re-add it when
   regenerating the skill set.
   - `speckit-init` always scaffolds Copilot **in skills mode**:
     `--integration copilot --integration-options="--skills"`. Skills mode makes
     spec-kit commands (and later-added extensions) install as Copilot Agent Skills
     (`.github/skills/speckit-<cmd>/SKILL.md`) instead of `.agent.md` files, which is
     what Copilot CLI discovers as `SKILL.md`. Do not drop `--integration-options="--skills"`.
   - Skills must not tell the user to pick or switch a different agent.

2. **Expose the rest of the `specify` surface as skills**, including nested
   `catalog` subcommands and `workflow step`:
   - `speckit-cli-setup` → detect/install the `specify` CLI (bootstrap; prerequisite for all others)
   - `speckit-init`    → `specify init` (Copilot only)
   - `speckit-check`   → `specify check`, `specify version`
   - `speckit-artifact` → `specify artifact …`
   - `speckit-extension` → `specify extension …` (+ `catalog`)
   - `speckit-preset`  → `specify preset …` (+ `catalog`)
   - `speckit-bundle`  → `specify bundle …` (+ `catalog`)
   - `speckit-workflow` → `specify workflow …` (+ `catalog`)
   - `speckit-workflow-step` → `specify workflow step …` (+ `catalog`)
   - `speckit-self`    → `specify self …`

   Every command-running skill carries a **Prerequisite** note that defers to
   `speckit-cli-setup` when `specify --version` fails. `speckit-cli-setup` installs the
   **latest** `specify-cli` from PyPI via `uv` (preferred) or `pipx`; `speckit-self`
   handles upgrading an already-installed CLI. Keep this prerequisite wiring when
   adding new skills.

3. **Plugins are independently versioned and are not pinned to Specify CLI.** The
   core `spec-kit-copilot` plugin targets the
   **latest** `specify` published on PyPI (package `specify-cli`), with a minimum floor
   of **>= 0.11** for the `bundle` / `workflow step` skills and **>= 1.0.7** for the
   `artifact` skill and preset/extension JSON inventory — do **not** hard-pin an
   `@vX.Y.Z` install tag in the skills. The plugin's own `version` in `plugin.json` and
   `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` is an **independent** semver that tracks changes to
   the plugin/skills themselves, not the CLI release. Marketplace metadata and each
   plugin entry must match the component they describe; do not force unrelated plugins
   to share a version. When revving a plugin, update its manifest, marketplace entry,
   and README version note together. Note: `specify init` stamps
   whichever installed CLI version ran it into the generated project
   (`.specify/init-options.json`, integration manifests), so the CLI version is
   determined at init time, not by this plugin.

4. **Skills are guidance, not dispatch.** SKILL.md frontmatter needs `name`
   (matching the directory), a discovery-oriented `description` (USE FOR / DO NOT
   USE FOR), and an `argument-hint`. The body lists the exact subcommands, options,
   and notes so the agent runs the real `specify` binary correctly.

5. **Picking up newly generated skills.** When a `specify` command writes new/changed
   `SKILL.md` files into the project's `.github/skills/` (extensions on `add`, bundles
   on `install`, and presets only if they regenerate skills), Copilot loads them in
   the **current** session via the `/skills reload` slash command — no restart needed —
   and automatically on the next session start. This is distinct from this plugin's own
   skills, which are refreshed with `copilot plugin install` / `/plugin`.

## Spec Kit presets (`spec-kit-presets/`) — keep the plumbing boundary

`spec-kit-presets/` holds **Copilot-specific Spec Kit presets** — this repo is their
canonical, sole home. Guard the boundary so contributors never conflate the two
toolchains:

- **Two different consumers.** Copilot plumbing (`plugin.json`, `skills/`, `plugins/`,
  `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`) is consumed by the **`copilot plugin`** CLI/App.
  Presets are consumed by the **`specify` CLI** (`specify preset add`). They are *not*
  Copilot plugins, skills, canvases, or marketplace entries.
- **Isolate, don't scatter.** All preset content — including its `catalog.json` — lives
  **inside** `spec-kit-presets/`. Do **not** put a preset `catalog.json` at the repo
  root, and do not mix it up with the Copilot marketplace manifest at
  `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`. Keep the boundary note in
  `spec-kit-presets/README.md`.
- **Naming convention: `copilot-<scope>[-<behavior>]`.** Preset ids (directory,
  `preset.yml` `id`, `catalog.json` key) carry a short **`copilot-`** prefix marking
  them Copilot-specific (e.g. `copilot-sub-agents`, `copilot-assess-ask-questions`),
  and display names lead with **"Copilot"** (e.g. "Copilot Sub-Agent Delegation").
  Do **not** use the full `spec-kit-copilot-*` plugin prefix for preset ids — that
  namespace is Copilot plugins (`copilot plugin`), and reusing it here would re-blur
  the plumbing boundary and bloat `specify preset add`.
- **Promotion criterion: Copilot-specific only.** A preset belongs here only if it
  depends on Copilot's own agent mechanisms (e.g. `copilot-sub-agents` uses the VS Code
  `runSubagent` tool / Copilot CLI sub-agents / `.github/agents/`; `copilot-assess-ask-questions`
  requires Copilot's interactive `ask_user` tool with no plain-text fallback).
  Agent-agnostic presets (generic themes, or workflows tied to an extension rather
  than to Copilot's tools) do **not** belong here. Do not import them.
- **Independent versioning & release.** Each preset carries its own `version` in
  `preset.yml` and a matching `catalog.json` entry, separate from plugin versions.
  Releases are cut by CI (`.github/workflows/release-preset.yml`), which zips the
  preset **inline** (no build script) on a pushed `<preset>-v<version>` tag; use the
  **Release Preset Trigger** workflow to create that tag from a preset id + version.
  When revving a preset, bump `preset.yml` + the `catalog.json` entry together
  **before** tagging.

## Spec Kit extensions (`spec-kit-extensions/`)

This directory and its `catalog.json` hold **Copilot-specific Specify CLI
extensions**, parallel to the preset catalog. Entries must depend on Copilot
tools or providers; do not import general-purpose extensions or add these packages
to the Copilot plugin marketplace. Keep each catalog entry's version, requirements,
and release URL aligned with its `extension.yml` and package README.
Package IDs, directory names, catalog keys, and ZIP basenames use
`extension-<name>` (for example, `extension-canvas-design`). Release tags use
`<extension-id>-vX.Y.Z` and release titles use `<extension-id> vX.Y.Z`, matching
the preset version suffix. Keep discovery tags such as `canvas-design`, template
IDs such as `canvas-settings-*`, and Copilot provider/tool IDs independent of
the package identity. Standard manifest filenames remain `extension.yml`.

Extensions are independently versioned and released through
`.github/workflows/release-extension-trigger.yml` (manual extension ID + version)
and `.github/workflows/release-extension.yml`. Keep both files structurally
aligned with their preset counterparts and Spec Kit's release model. Only
package-specific naming prefixes, tag filters, input examples, and terminology
differ; apply shared behavior fixes to both package types. The trigger validates its inputs,
creates and pushes the tag; the separate tag-push workflow validates, zips, and
publishes in one job.
Do not add extension-only jobs, triggers, routing guards, or reusable calls.
Bump the manifest, catalog entry, and package README together before releasing.
Both trigger checkouts use `token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PAT }}` and persist that
credential for the tag push, matching Spec Kit's core release trigger. Configure
the repository Actions secret with a token authorized to push tags; do not
replace it with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose pushes do not trigger another workflow.
Preset publishers listen for `copilot-*-vX.Y.Z` tags and extension publishers
listen for `extension-*-vX.Y.Z` tags, so releases do not start the other package
type's workflow. Parse versions after the final `-v`, and pass changelog notes
through a file rather than interpolating them into shell scripts.
Both manual triggers must verify the requested version against the manifest and
catalog before creating a tag. Both triggers and publishers must verify that the
catalog `download_url` matches the release repository, tag, and ZIP asset name;
keep these checks aligned so direct tag pushes cannot bypass them.
Require manifest IDs to match the selected directory in both triggers and
publishers. Package IDs use lowercase letters, digits, and single hyphen
separators with the `copilot-` preset or `extension-` extension prefix. Reject
symlinks in the package root or contents before reading manifests or creating
archives; shell `zip` follows links and must never archive files outside the
package.

## Advanced CodeQL scanning

`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` follows Spec Kit's advanced workflow, retaining
this repository's `actions` and `javascript-typescript` languages and default
query suite. It scans pushes and pull requests targeting `main`, without path
filters or fork exclusions. Use `pull_request`, never `pull_request_target` with
untrusted code; GitHub's fork-contributor workflow approval policies still apply.
The Tuesday 04:23 UTC schedule deliberately preserves default setup's weekly
coverage, beyond Spec Kit's unscheduled workflow. Keep actions SHA-pinned and
the analysis job limited to `contents: read` and `security-events: write`.
No dependency installation or build step is needed for these languages.

Activation requires a coordinated maintainer switch, not just a YAML change:

1. Review and merge the replacement workflow while default setup remains enabled.
   Default setup rejects advanced CodeQL SARIF uploads while both are present.
2. Once the approved workflow is on `main`, an authorized maintainer must disable
   default setup in the target repository's code-scanning settings and re-run the
   merge-triggered CodeQL workflow. Do not disable default setup prematurely.
3. Verify successful uploads for both `/language:actions` and
   `/language:javascript-typescript` on `main` and an approved fork PR run.
   Local YAML checks are not evidence of a live scan. Required checks, rulesets,
   fork Actions settings, and other security settings are separate maintainer
   decisions; do not change them as part of this switch.

## When revving the core skills plugin

1. Re-enumerate the `specify` CLI surface for the **latest** release
   (`specify <group> --help`, including nested `catalog` / `step` groups).
2. Add/adjust skills for new or changed command groups — but keep decision (1):
   no integration-management skill, and `init` stays Copilot + skills mode
   (`--integration copilot --integration-options="--skills"`).
3. Bump the core plugin's `version` in `plugin.json` and its marketplace entry
   together. Bump marketplace metadata when the catalog changes. Do not bump
   `spec-kit-copilot-assess` unless that plugin changes. Update the README "Versioning"
   note. Keep the `speckit-cli-setup` skill installing the
   **latest** `specify-cli` from PyPI (no `@vX.Y.Z` pin); only touch the `>= 0.11`
   and `>= 1.0.7` minimum notes if the floors actually change.
4. Reinstall and verify. `copilot plugin install` takes a `plugin@marketplace`,
   `owner/repo`, `owner/repo:path`, or git URL — it does **not** accept a local path.
   After the change is pushed and the marketplace catalog is refreshed
   (`copilot plugin marketplace update spec-kit-marketplace`), run
   `copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot@spec-kit-marketplace` (or
   `copilot plugin update`) and confirm `copilot plugin list` reports the new version
   with the expected skill count.
