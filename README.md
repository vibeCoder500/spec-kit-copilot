# Spec Kit for GitHub Copilot

**Copilot-native integrations for Spec Kit across GitHub Copilot CLI, the Copilot
App, and VS Code.**

This repository hosts Copilot-specific integrations and Spec Kit components tailored
for Copilot: CLI skills, App canvases, and future plugins, hooks, or workflow surfaces.
Spec Kit remains agent-agnostic; this companion repository provides the first-class
Copilot experience around it.

**Status:** active development.

## Background

[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) provides the `specify` CLI and
agent-independent foundations for Spec-Driven Development. This repository packages
the integrations that are specifically useful to Copilot users without adding
Copilot-only behavior to the core Spec Kit project.

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started, and
[open issues](https://github.com/github/spec-kit-copilot/issues) for the current roadmap.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Version | Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec-kit-copilot` | 0.15.0 | Copilot CLI and App agent | Core skills that teach Copilot how to run `specify` |
| `spec-kit-copilot-assess` | 0.1.0 | Copilot App canvas | Optional visual dashboard for the Spec Kit `assess` extension |
| `spec-kit-copilot-bugfix` | 0.1.0 | Copilot App canvas | Optional visual dashboard for the Spec Kit `bug` extension |
| `spec-kit-copilot-sdd` | 0.1.0 | Copilot App canvas | Optional visual dashboard for the core spec-driven development workflow |
| `spec-kit-copilot-wizard` | 0.1.1 | Copilot App canvas | Optional guided wizard canvas for the full Spec Kit lifecycle |

The plugins are independently installable and versioned. Install the core skills,
the assessment canvas, the bug fix canvas, the spec-driven development canvas, the
wizard canvas, or any combination.

## Spec Kit presets

This repo also hosts **Copilot-specific Spec Kit presets** under
[`spec-kit-presets/`](spec-kit-presets). These are *not* Copilot plugins — they are
consumed by the **`specify` CLI** (`specify preset add`), and are kept in their own
isolated subtree (with their own `catalog.json`) so Spec Kit plumbing is never
confused with Copilot plugin/marketplace plumbing.

| Preset | Requires | Why it is Copilot-specific |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`copilot-sub-agents`](spec-kit-presets/copilot-sub-agents) | Spec Kit `>= 0.8.0` | Uses Copilot delegation — VS Code `runSubagent`, Copilot CLI sub-agents, `.github/agents/` |
| [`copilot-assess-ask-questions`](spec-kit-presets/copilot-assess-ask-questions) | Spec Kit `>= 0.9.0`, `assess` extension | Drives the assess pipeline through Copilot's interactive `ask_user` tool (no plain-text fallback) |

See [`spec-kit-presets/README.md`](spec-kit-presets/README.md) for the plumbing
boundary, install commands, and versioning. Only Copilot-specific presets are hosted
here; agent-agnostic presets do not belong in this Copilot integration hub.

## Core skills plugin

`spec-kit-copilot` gives Copilot focused skills—one per `specify` command group—so
the agent knows when and how to drive the CLI on your behalf.

| Skill | Wraps | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `speckit-cli-setup` | install / `specify --version` | Detect and install the `specify` CLI the other skills depend on |
| `speckit-init` | `specify init` | Scaffold a new Copilot spec-driven project (or `--here`) |
| `speckit-check` | `specify check`, `specify version` | Verify tools, report version/features |
| `speckit-extension` | `specify extension …` | Install/update/search spec-kit extensions (+ catalogs) |
| `speckit-preset` | `specify preset …` | Install/search/resolve presets (+ catalogs) |
| `speckit-bundle` | `specify bundle …` | Discover, install, update, and author bundles (+ catalogs) |
| `speckit-workflow` | `specify workflow …` | Run/resume/inspect automation workflows (+ catalogs) |
| `speckit-workflow-step` | `specify workflow step …` | Manage workflow step types (+ catalogs) |
| `speckit-self` | `specify self …` | Check for and apply CLI upgrades |

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body). The `description`
field tells Copilot when to load the skill; the body documents the exact `specify`
sub-commands, options, and usage notes. The plugin is described by the
[`plugin.json`](plugin.json) manifest at the repository root.

## Canvases

Optional Copilot **App** canvas plugins render a side-panel dashboard for a Spec Kit
workflow. Each has its own plugin manifest and release cadence, is not enabled by
installing the core skills, and rides the experimental canvas SDK. See each canvas's
own README for full details.

| Canvas | Plugin | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assess-canvas`](plugins/spec-kit-copilot-assess/extensions/assess-canvas/README.md) | `spec-kit-copilot-assess` | Dashboard for the optional `assess` extension — the intake → research → define → shape → decide funnel. |
| [`bugfix-canvas`](plugins/spec-kit-copilot-bugfix/extensions/bugfix-canvas/README.md) | `spec-kit-copilot-bugfix` | Dashboard for the optional `bug` extension — the assess → fix → test triage pipeline. |
| [`sdd-canvas`](plugins/spec-kit-copilot-sdd/extensions/sdd-canvas/README.md) | `spec-kit-copilot-sdd` | Dashboard for the core spec-driven workflow — constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → checklist → implement. |
| [`speckit-wizard-canvas`](plugins/spec-kit-copilot-wizard/extensions/speckit-wizard-canvas/README.md) | `spec-kit-copilot-wizard` | Guided wizard for the full Spec Kit lifecycle — setup → constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → checklist → implement, with preset / extension / composition inspectors. |

## Requirements

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/about-copilot-cli)
- Copilot CLI 1.0.71 or later when installing `spec-kit-copilot-assess`
- The Spec Kit `specify` CLI on your `PATH`:

  ```bash
  uv tool install specify-cli      # or: pipx install specify-cli
  specify --version
  ```

> **Versioning:** each plugin has an independent version and is not pinned to a
> specific Specify CLI version. The core plugin targets the **latest** `specify`
> published on PyPI (package `specify-cli`), with a
> minimum floor of **>= 0.11** for the `bundle` / `workflow step` skills. Install or
> upgrade with `uv tool install specify-cli` / `uv tool upgrade specify-cli` (or the
> `pipx` equivalents), or `specify self upgrade`. Each plugin's own `version` is
> independent of the CLI version.

## Installation

The development branch adds optional Azure DevOps repository browsing and
confirmed local clone preparation to SDD. See the
[repository browser guide](docs/sdd-repository-browser.md). This change is not
published by this checkout; existing marketplace versions and preview ZIPs are
unchanged. Release version updates remain a separate approval step.

### Via marketplace (recommended)

This repository ships a marketplace manifest at
[`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`](.github/plugin/marketplace.json). Register the
marketplace, then install any combination of the plugins:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add OWNER/spec-kit-copilot
copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot@spec-kit-marketplace
copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot-assess@spec-kit-marketplace
copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot-bugfix@spec-kit-marketplace
copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot-sdd@spec-kit-marketplace
copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot-wizard@spec-kit-marketplace
```

### Local development loading

Load any of the plugins directly from a checkout while iterating:

```bash
copilot --plugin-dir . plugin list
copilot --plugin-dir plugins/spec-kit-copilot-assess plugin list
copilot --plugin-dir plugins/spec-kit-copilot-bugfix plugin list
copilot --plugin-dir plugins/spec-kit-copilot-sdd plugin list
copilot --plugin-dir plugins/spec-kit-copilot-wizard plugin list
```

Verify it loaded:

```bash
copilot plugin list
# or, inside an interactive session:
/skills list
```

For a persistent branch install, use `OWNER/REPO` for the core plugin or
`OWNER/REPO:plugins/spec-kit-copilot-assess` for the canvas plugin.

Uninstall with the plugin's `name` (from `plugin.json`), not its path:

```bash
copilot plugin uninstall spec-kit-copilot
copilot plugin uninstall spec-kit-copilot-assess
copilot plugin uninstall spec-kit-copilot-bugfix
copilot plugin uninstall spec-kit-copilot-sdd
copilot plugin uninstall spec-kit-copilot-wizard
```

## Usage

Just talk to Copilot in natural language; it selects the matching skill and runs the
right `specify` command. For example:

- "Initialize a spec-kit project here for Copilot" → `speckit-init`
- "Check my spec-kit environment" → `speckit-check`
- "Add the git extension" → `speckit-extension`
- "Run the taskstoissues workflow" → `speckit-workflow`
- "Install the platform-starter bundle" → `speckit-bundle`
- "Is there a newer specify release?" → `speckit-self`

### Opening a canvas dashboard

The **Assessment canvas**, **Bug fix canvas**, **Spec-driven development
canvas**, and **Spec Kit Wizard** plugins are *canvas extensions*: they
render in the **GitHub Copilot app** side panel, not the terminal CLI.
Installing one only registers its canvas — nothing opens automatically.
To open a dashboard, ask Copilot, e.g. **"Open the Idea Assessment
pipeline"**, **"Open the Bug Fix Pipeline"**, **"Open Spec-Driven
Development"**, or **"Open the Spec Kit Wizard"**. The agent opens the
matching canvas in a side panel; from there you can click its buttons
or ask the agent to drive the stages. There is no slash command or menu
entry. See each plugin's README for details.

## Walkthroughs

> [!NOTE]
> Community walkthroughs are independently created and maintained by their respective authors. Review their content before following along and use at your own discretion.

See this plugin driving Spec-Driven Development end to end with this community-contributed walkthrough:

- **[Issue-to-implementation with the assess extension](https://github.com/mnriem/spec-kit-copilot-plugin-demo)** — Takes a raw GitHub issue from idea to shipped change entirely through GitHub Copilot CLI and this plugin: first the Idea Assessment Pipeline (the `assess` extension — intake → research → define → shape → decide) turns the issue into a scored go/no-go decision, then Spec-Driven Development (specify → plan → tasks → implement) delivers the change. Every step documents the exact prompt entered into Copilot.
