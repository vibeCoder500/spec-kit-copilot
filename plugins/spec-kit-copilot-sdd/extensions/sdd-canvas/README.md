# sdd-canvas

A GitHub Copilot **canvas extension** that wraps the Spec Kit core
**Spec-Driven Development** workflow — the pipeline that takes a feature from an
idea to shipped code:

```
constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → checklist → implement
```

The canvas gives that workflow a side-panel UI: it lists every feature under
`specs/<feature>/`, shows which stages are done, previews each Markdown
artifact, and drives the pipeline by invoking the generated core `speckit-*`
skills through the agent.

## Quickstart

> This is a **canvas extension** — it opens in the **GitHub Copilot app** side
> panel, not the terminal CLI. There is no slash command or menu entry.

1. Register the marketplace and install it (see [Install](#install)):

   ```bash
   copilot plugin marketplace add OWNER/spec-kit-copilot
   copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot-sdd@spec-kit-marketplace
   ```
2. Ask Copilot in chat: **"Open Spec-Driven Development"**.

The agent opens the dashboard in a side panel. See
[Opening the dashboard](#opening-the-dashboard) for details.

## What it does

- **Pipeline overview** — a live count of how many features have reached each
  primary milestone (`specify` / `plan` / `tasks` / `implement`).
- **Project constitution** — a top-level card showing whether the project
  constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is missing, still a template,
  or ratified, with one-click **Create / update** and **View**.
- **Per-feature cards** — title, feature slug, an **active** badge for the
  feature recorded in `.specify/feature.json`, `clarified` / checklist badges, a
  task-completion progress bar, a pill per stage (done / next / available /
  stale / pending), and a **Run &lt;next stage&gt;** button.
- **Full core flow, essential and optional** — every card exposes all eight
  commands: the essential spine (**specify → plan → tasks → implement**) plus the
  optional quality gates **clarify** (before plan), **analyze** (after tasks),
  and **checklist**.
- **Correct ordering, enforced** — clarify/plan/checklist need a current
  `spec.md`, tasks needs `plan.md`, analyze/implement need `tasks.md`. The rules
  are enforced both in the UI and server-side.
- **Rerun with overwrite** — rerunning `plan` or `tasks` explicitly authorizes
  overwrite, uses the existing artifact as context, preserves still-valid
  content, and marks later artifacts stale until rerun.
- **Analyze is honest about state** — `analyze` is read-only and writes no file,
  so it is always available once `tasks.md` exists but never shows a persistent
  "done" badge.
- **Rendered artifact preview** — view `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and the
  constitution as formatted headings, lists, code, blockquotes, and tables in a
  dedicated full-width canvas view with a **Back to dashboard** control.
- **Targeted clarification** — `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` markers in a spec render
  a **Clarify** action. The canvas requires an answer in a confirmation dialog
  before it sends a validated `clarify` run for that feature to the agent.
- **New feature → specify** — describe what you want to build and kick off
  `speckit-specify`, which creates the feature spec under `specs/`.
- **Guided prerequisite setup** — when Spec Kit is not initialized in Copilot
  skills mode, the canvas makes setup the first step and sends the required
  setup work to the agent instead of forwarding an unavailable command.
- **Live updates** — the panel refreshes automatically (SSE) as the core
  commands write new artifacts.

Artifact browsing never writes spec files. Optional repository browsing adds an
explicitly confirmed clone into a new owned local folder; it never overwrites an
existing checkout. Workflow edits still run through the core commands and the
current Copilot session's permissions.

## Optional Repository Browser

This unreleased development build includes an Azure DevOps repository search
dropdown with expandable `.specify` and `specs` trees, a personalized team rail,
commit-pinned Markdown previews, and confirmed clone preparation. It requires a
trusted per-user connection profile. Without that profile, the existing local
SDD experience remains unchanged and no remote connection is attempted.

The connected Microsoft account determines repository access. GitHub Copilot
sign-in is not reused as an Azure DevOps token. Authentication uses the system
browser and delegated Microsoft Entra access; tokens stay in the extension's
memory and are discarded on disconnect or close.

After cloning, open the prepared folder in a new App session. The canvas verifies
the actual Git workspace and initial source before local workflows can run.
Project-local skills and the canvas provider still need to be present in that
session; cloning does not install them or run project initialization. Verified,
unchanged cloned artifacts use committed times so checkout order does not create
false stale-stage warnings. Local modifications retain the normal freshness rules.

See the [repository browser guide](../../../../docs/sdd-repository-browser.md)
for configuration, permissions, native handoff, cancellation, and recovery.

## Feature targeting

Because `speckit-specify` auto-generates the feature directory (e.g.
`specs/003-user-auth`), downstream commands are told which feature to operate on
by exporting `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=specs/<feature>` in the prompt the canvas
sends. This matches Spec Kit's own feature-resolution order (explicit
`SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY`, then `.specify/feature.json`).

## Opening the dashboard

This is a **canvas extension**, so it renders in the **GitHub Copilot app** side
panel — not in the plain terminal CLI. Installing the plugin only *registers* the
canvas; nothing opens automatically.

To open it, ask Copilot in chat, e.g. **"Open Spec-Driven Development"** (or "open
the SDD dashboard"). The agent matches your request to this canvas
(`id: sdd-canvas`, displayName **"Spec-Driven Development"**) and opens it in a
side panel. There is no slash command or menu entry — discovery is the agent
matching the canvas name/description.

Once it is open you can drive it two ways:

- **Click the panel** — the constitution card, the New feature → specify form,
  and each card's stage pills, Run/Rerun, and Clarify buttons.
- **Ask the agent** — the canvas also exposes agent-callable actions
  (`list_features`, `setup_sdd`, `run_stage`, `clarify_item`).

If the project isn't set up for Spec Kit in Copilot skills mode, the canvas
shows a setup step first.

## How it drives the pipeline

Buttons in the canvas POST to a loopback HTTP endpoint, which calls
`session.send({ prompt: "/skill:speckit-<command> …" })`. The skill runs in your
normal chat session — watch the transcript for the agent's work and any prompts
(e.g. URL-fetch approval).

Each open canvas gets a random capability token. The loopback server requires
that token and its canonical Host/Origin on UI, API, and event-stream requests.

Commands are restricted to the eight core `speckit-*` skills and feature slugs
are normalized to `[a-z0-9-]`, so the canvas can only trigger core SDD stages.

## Agent-callable actions

- `list_features` — returns all features with per-stage progress, clarify /
  checklist gate status, implementation task progress, the active feature, and
  the project constitution status.
- `setup_sdd` — asks the agent to initialize Spec Kit in Copilot skills mode.
- `clarify_item` — validates a clarification by feature/index/question, captures
  the user's answer, and runs `clarify` for that feature.
- `run_stage` — runs or reruns a command
  (`{ key, feature?, description?, instructions?, overwrite? }`). Use
  `key: "specify"` with a `description` to create a feature; other keys operate
  on an existing feature slug. Rerunning `plan` / `tasks` requires
  `overwrite: true`.

## Install

**Via marketplace (recommended):**

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add OWNER/spec-kit-copilot
copilot plugin install spec-kit-copilot-sdd@spec-kit-marketplace
```

The plugin manifest lives at `plugins/spec-kit-copilot-sdd/plugin.json` and
declares this directory through its `extensions/` component path.

**Anywhere else (gist):** share it as a private gist
("Share extension as gist…" in the command palette, or the `share_extension`
tool), then install with "Install extension from gist…" into
`~/.copilot/extensions/` so it follows you across projects. The bundled
`copilot-extension.json` manifest is what makes the gist install flow recognize
it.

## Requirements

The canvas detects whether the project is initialized and whether the core
spec-driven skills are installed. If either prerequisite is missing, it presents
a setup action before the new-feature form. Features are written under
`specs/<feature>/`; the constitution under `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `extension.mjs` | SDK wiring: per-instance loopback server, HTTP + SSE endpoints, canvas actions, `session.send` driving with `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` targeting. |
| `sdd.mjs` | Filesystem scan: project-root resolution, per-feature stage/gate detection, task-progress and constitution status, safe artifact reads. |
| `index.html` | The dashboard UI (served to the canvas iframe). |
| `copilot-extension.json` | Manifest for gist share/install. |
